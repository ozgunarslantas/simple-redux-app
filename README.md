## What is this project?

This project builds a very simple `react` app using `redux` as the state management tool and the `redux-observable` as the middleware.<br />
The steps from the https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/learn-redux-introduction-to-state-management-with-react-b87bc570b12a is followed.<br />
More information on setting up the middleware can be found at https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/SettingUpTheMiddleware.html.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
